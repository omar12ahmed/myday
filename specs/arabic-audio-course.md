# A voice across the Arabic course: the plan

**Status:** a plan for the owner's decision. Nothing is built.
**Date:** 20 October 2026, after release 1.39.0.
**The numbers:** from `app/scripts/arabic-audio-inventory.mjs`. Run it by hand, with `--rounds` for the sizes in §4.

## 1. The question, and the short answer

**The question:** can all the Arabic text in the course have a voice, like the 48 starter words since 1.39.0?

**The short answer:** about 60% of it can, in two more rounds. That's 572 clips and about an hour of listening for
you, spread over the rounds. The rest needs a teacher or a fluent speaker first.
- **Cost and size aren't the problem.** The whole course is about 24,000 characters. Google's free allowance is a
  million a month, and the clips would add about 6 MB to the repository.
- **The limit is checking.** A synthesised voice reads exactly what's written. Where the text has its vowel marks,
  you and the transcription check can compare what you hear with what's written. Where it has none, the voice has to
  guess the vowels and endings, and nobody here can tell when it guesses wrong.

## 2. What's in the course

1,110 distinct pieces of Arabic, 23,922 characters in all:
- **641 are fully vowelled;**
- **56 are partly vowelled;**
- **413 have no vowel marks.**

199 pieces appear in more than one place, so one clip can serve them all.

| Where it's shown | Distinct pieces | Fully vowelled | No marks | What they are, mostly |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vocabulary: starter words and examples | 95 | 94 | 0 | Voiced since 1.39.0 |
| A lesson's headline example | 149 | 146 | 3 | Phrases and sentences |
| Teaching: examples, try it, solutions, explanations | 525 | 427 | 89 | Words, phrases, sentences |
| Reading texts, A1–A2 (8 texts) | 8 | 8 | 0 | Short passages, 5–11 sentences each |
| Reading texts, B1–B2 (6 texts) | 6 | 0 | 6 | Passages written without marks, as Arabic usually is |
| Lesson checks (questions) | 217 | 27 | 175 | Single letters and words inside English questions |
| Answers, behind a button | 196 | 35 | 138 | Mostly written without marks |
| A lesson's key concepts | 87 | 3 | 76 | Mostly letter groups (ا د ذ ر ز و) |
| Practical tasks | 78 | 16 | 60 | Words inside English instructions |
| Sound pairs, timetable, word families | 59 | 38 | 19 | Minimal pairs (قَلْب / كَلْب), days and places |

Every reading text also has a version without marks, and the app lets you switch between the two. The 8 A1–A2 texts
have a vowelled version; the 6 B1–B2 texts have only the version without marks.

## 3. What should have a voice, and what shouldn't

1. **Only fully vowelled text.** The voice reads what's written, and the marks are how both you and the cross-check
   know it read correctly. It's the same rule as round one.
2. **No letter drills.** Groups like ب ت ث ن ي would be read as letter names ("bāʾ, tāʾ, thāʾ…"). The lessons want
   the sounds, and those are better taught with the course's own recordings (the Madinah links). That's 73 pieces.
3. **Never before an answer is shown.** Some lesson checks and "try it" items would be answered just by listening.
   "Which article lām is pronounced: in الْقَمَر or in الشَّمْس?" is one. So in checks, answers and "try it",
   the play buttons appear only once you've revealed the answer. Revision cards stay as they are.
4. **Reading texts by sentence.** Each sentence is its own clip, made from the vowelled version.
   - One **Listen** button plays the whole text, sentence by sentence.
   - Tapping a sentence plays just that one.
   - The same audio plays when you're reading the version without marks, so you can listen while you practise
     reading without marks.
   - One clip per sentence makes retakes cheap and a slip easy to find.
   - In the two dialogues, the speaker's name at the start of a line ("سَامِي:") isn't read out; each line's clip
     holds only what is said.
5. **Listening activities stay as they are.** The course's listening tasks expect a human or external recording. A
   synthesised clip is a model to copy and never counts as listening practice done, as in round one.
6. **The same label everywhere:** "Synthesised voice — a model to copy; checked by ear, not yet by a teacher."

## 4. The rounds

| Round | Clips | Characters | Audio | Your listening, about |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Two:** the lessons' headline examples | 136 | 2,948 | 6 min | 15 min |
| **Three (a):** the 8 vowelled reading texts, by sentence | 55 | 2,268 | 5 min | 11 min |
| **Three (b):** teaching examples, try it and solutions | 336 | 6,325 | 13 min | 31 min |
| **Three (b):** sound pairs and word-family forms | 23 | 195 | under 1 min | 1 min |
| **Three (b):** check questions and answers, once the answer is shown | 22 | 378 | 1 min | 2 min |
| **Held back** (see §6) | 498 + 6 texts | | | |

"Your listening" allows for playing each clip about twice and ticking the checklist. Round three (b) is best done in
two sittings.

**Each round works like round one.**
- **On the Mac:**
  1. a Text-to-Speech-only key is made, and deleted afterwards;
  2. the clips are made in the same voice (Chirp 3 HD Charon);
  3. Gemini transcribes every clip, and any clip it hears differently is made again;
  4. you listen on a checklist page and tick anything that sounds off;
  5. the clips are made again until they're right;
  6. the full test run, a release, and a live check.
- **The cost is about nothing:**
  - **Text-to-Speech:** within the free allowance (to be confirmed on the day).
  - **Gemini's cross-check:** about US$0.04 for round two and about US$0.15 for round three.

## 5. How it would work in the app

- **One clip per distinct text, shared wherever that text appears.**
  - `content/arabic-audio/audio-audit.json` today is keyed by starter word. It would be keyed by the **exact text**
    instead, listing where each text is used.
  - The app's `voice-clips.json` would map text to clip file.
  - The 96 clips already made would move over unchanged.
- **Play buttons only where we place them,** never automatically on every bit of Arabic: the lesson's example, the
  reading text's Listen and its sentences, and teaching examples and solutions. The answers and "try it" only after
  they're revealed. This keeps rule 3 safe.
- **The build check grows with it.**
  - `prepare-audio.mjs` still fails on a file that doesn't match its name, a cut-short file, a stray file or an
    unknown check.
  - It would now also fail on a clip whose text no longer appears anywhere in the course (so a changed sentence can't
    keep an old voice).
  - Only clips you've listened to ship.
- **Unchanged:**
  - the service worker, which keeps each clip the first time it plays;
  - the Slower switch;
  - saved data, so going back to an earlier release stays safe;
  - the server and the database.

## 6. Text without vowel marks

This covers the 6 B1–B2 reading texts and 358 other pieces, mostly check questions, answers and key concepts.

| Option | What it means | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| A. Leave it without a voice | Its honest "no recording" notes stay | Nothing to check; nothing gained |
| B. A fluent speaker checks synthesised clips | The voice guesses the vowels; a fluent speaker listens to every clip | Needs a fluent speaker's time |
| C. A vowelled copy, reviewed | A person (or an AI draft) adds marks in a separate copy, a teacher reviews it, then it's voiced like round three. The course's own text never changes: it drops marks on purpose | A teacher's time, plus extra authored content to keep |
| D. A human recording | A competent Fuṣḥā speaker records the 6 B1–B2 texts; the course itself asks for this | The best model to copy; needs a speaker and permission |

**Recommendation: A for now.** Then D for the 6 B1–B2 texts if a fluent speaker becomes available, and B for the rest
at that point. Don't use an AI-vowelled copy without a teacher's review: it would look checked when it isn't.

## 7. Questions for you

1. **Round two now?** It's the 136 lesson examples, about 15 minutes of listening.
   *Recommendation: yes.*
2. **In round three, the reading texts first?** That's round three (a), about 11 minutes of listening. They're the
   biggest step up: a whole text read aloud, which you can follow with or without vowel marks.
   *Recommendation: yes, reading texts before the teaching items.*
3. **Voices in checks, answers and "try it" only after the answer is shown?**
   *Recommendation: yes. Otherwise some checks are answered just by listening.*
4. **Letter drills: no voice?**
   *Recommendation: no voice. Letter names would mislead; the course's linked recordings teach the sounds.*
5. **One voice for everything, dialogues included?** Two of the A1–A2 texts are dialogues between Sāmī and Laylā.
   With one voice, a male voice also reads Laylā's lines.
   *Recommendation: one voice for now. A second voice would mean another trial and a second voice to check; the
   speaker's name stays on the page.*
6. **Text without vowel marks: option A until a fluent speaker or teacher is available?** And would you like to look
   for one, who could also check rounds one to three?
   *Recommendation: A for now, and yes, worth looking for one.*
